Vulnerability:
	The server allows password reset requests to be submitted for arbitrary users without verifying that the requester is the legitimate account owner.
	As long as the request is authenticated with any valid session, the server processes the password change.
	
Exploit:
	An attacker can register a new account and brute-force or enumerate existing users' passwords while resetting their passwords in the processâ€”all while authenticated as a different, legitimate user.
	
Explenation:
	-	Sign up as a new user and log in.
	-	Capture the password reset request from this authenticated session.
	-	Modify the request to target another user and set a new password.
	-	Ensure a valid session cookie or token is included in each request.
	-	Repeat the request with various target passwords.
	-	Observe whether the server responds with a success message like "Password reset successfully."
	-	Incase of faliure with changing the password, log back in and repeate the process.
	
Prevention:
	Ensure that password reset operations can only be performed by the user associated with the authenticated session.
