Vulnerability:
	The server trusts the Host header to generate password reset links.
	By injecting a malicious host, the reset link sent to the user leaks the token to the attacker.
	
Exploit:
	While submitting a password reset request, intercept and modify the Host header to an attacker controlled domain.
	The server uses this header to build the reset link sent to the user, and when the user clicks it, the token is exposed in the attackerâ€™s server logs.
	
Example:
	None
	
Prevention:
	Validate the Host header against a whitelist of allowed domains.
