Vulnerability:
	The server only checks the password if the username is valid.
	An attacker can brute-force usernames using a very long password to determine which usernames are valid by observing response timing.
	
Exploit:
	Brute-force usernames with a very long password to cause a response delay when a valid username is used, then brute-force the passwords for that username. 
	
Example:
	NONE
	
Prevention:
	- Always check the password, even if the username does not exist.
	- Limit the length of the password processed by the server without notifying the user that their input password is too long.
