Vulnerability:
	In case of multiple failed login attempts using a *valid/existing* username, the server responds with a message indicating that the account is temporarily locked.
	However, when using a non-existent username, the server does not show such a message.
	This allows an attacker to enumerate valid usernames based on the account lock response.

Exploit:
	- Bruteeforce the same username with a wrong password 4 times to reveal the lock/cooldown message.
	- Bruteforce the password while checking if the account was locked and try again the same request until the request was proccesed.
	
Example:
	None
	
Prevention:
	- Reply with the same cooldown messasge even if the username is not valid.
