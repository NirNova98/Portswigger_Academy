Vulnerability:
	The server is not sanitizing the input.
	Allowing an attacker to add a piece of code to it.
	
Exploit:
	productId=2&storeId=2;whoami
	
Explenation:
	The server takes the input of the parameter "storeId" as a whole without checking if it is a valid / expected value, so by adding the ; to it, we can add any command afterwards. 
	
Prevention:
	- Allow only numbers for the input as it is supposed to be.
	- Sanitize the input value.
