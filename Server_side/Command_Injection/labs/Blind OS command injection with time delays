Vulnerability:
	One of the input fields is not sanitizing correctly,
	Allowing an attacker to escape input and execute a command.
	
Exploit:
	Add double quotes in the message input field, followed by a semicolon and your command.
	
Example:
	...  
	&message=mishmash";ping+-c+10+8.8.8.8"
	
Prevention:
	- Do not allow double quotes in input, or escape them using a backslash (\).
