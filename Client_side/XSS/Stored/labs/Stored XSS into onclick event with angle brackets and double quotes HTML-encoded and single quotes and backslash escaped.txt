Vulnerability:
	Poor input sanitization allows injection into the onclick attribute of a <button> tag, enabling script execution
	
Exploit:
	Exploit Script:
		&apos;-alert(1)-&apos;
	
Explanation:
	The browser decode attributes value before executing,
	So by adding (&apos;) the browser will decode it to a single quote (').
	Also, after the second &apos; which is ('), there is another quote, those two are invalid to sit in the middle of the code like so: [alert(1) ''] and cause an error.
	To prevent this, add '-' to keep the code valid and the injected code syntactically correct.
	
Prevention:
	Properly escape or sanitize all user input, including HTML-encoded values.
