Vulnerability:
	The server does not sanitize the input,
	Allowing an attacker to escape into the code via a parameter in the URL and inject JS. 
	
Exploit:
	Injection Point:
		<a href="javascript:fetch('/analytics', {method:'post',body:'/post%3fpostId%3d3[PAYLOAD]'}).finally(_ => window.location = '/')">Back to Blog</a>

	Exploit Script:
		https://server.net/post?postId=1&'},toString=a=>{throw/**/onerror=alert,1337},window+'',{b:'
	
Explanation:
	& - To be able to inject other characters without the page ignoring the request.
	'} - Escape and close the body string then the option object (second parameter) in the fetch function.
	toString=a=>{throw/**/onerror=alert,1337}:
		toString=a=>{..} - Assigns function a to toString, overriding it's defualt value.
			throw - Stops execution and causes a runtime error, triggering the global variable 'window.onerror'.
			onerror=alert - Assigns the built-in alert function to the global onerror handler.
			1337 - This value is thrown and uncaught, triggering an error that passes it as the first argument to the alert function.
		window+'' - Triggers 'window.toString()', which now runs the function a() that was assigned to toString.
	
Prevention:
	Do not allow any value in the 'postId' parameter which is not an intiger.
