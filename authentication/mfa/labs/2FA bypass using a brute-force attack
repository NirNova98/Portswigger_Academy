Vulnerability:
	The MFA is a 4 digit string, which allows an attacker to have a high enought chances to hit the correct value of the mfa by bruteforcing the entire proces even if the user was logged out by the server.
				
Exploit:
	Bruteforcing the loggin and the mfa process again and again using the same MFA value or changing it  while updating the session and the CSRF token and add them  each to the relevent request so the automation will work without causing an wrror in the server until you guess the correct MFA.

Example:
	NONE

Prevention:
	- Make the MFA longer, lower & uppercase letters.
	- Lock the user after some falling attempts or make a cooldown of a minute or so before accepting a new attempt to log in.
