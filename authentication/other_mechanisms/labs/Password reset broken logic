Vulnerability:
	When setting a new password, the server validates the reset token but relies on a separate parameter to identify the username.
	This allows an attacker to change the password for any user by modifying that parameter.
	
Exploit:
	After submitting the new password, intercept the request and change the username parameter to the target user's username.
	
Example:
	None
	
Prevention:
	Bind the token to the specific user on the server side, so the reset link is only valid for that user.
