Vulnerability:
	The server checks for the validity of the host header value, It uses a user-controlled header to build the reset link, which allows an attacker to redirect the link to their domain.
	
Exploit:
	While submitting a password reset request, intercept it and add a header called X-Forwarded-Host with an attacker-controlled domain.
	The server uses this header to build the reset link sent to the user, and when the user clicks it, the token is exposed in the attackerâ€™s server logs.
	
Example:
	None
	
Prevention:
	Read the URL only from the host header after validating it's value.
